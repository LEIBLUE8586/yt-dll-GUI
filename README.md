# YT Dlp GUI by Nofal Samadi/Leiblue8586

# About
This is a Repo for Nofal Samadi's yt-dlp GUI/yt-dlg (Turns out im not the only one making em).
The idea is simple, a GUI/App that can install youtube vids through a simple tkinter app accessable to all for use in
the PC platform. basicly just something simple i wanna make to just give back to the people and myself. Gonna use this myself
so expect updates but not too soon.
hope you all enjoy!

# How to Install and Use
Download the .exe inside the dist folder to use the app. make sure to download yt-dlp from Github.
Make sure both yt-dlp and yt-dlg/yt-dlp-GUI is inside the same folder for easy access.
from their, just fill in what you can.
the yt-dlp.exe path (If failed to load inside PATH) should be filled for use.
everything else should be fine if you can open github honestly.
